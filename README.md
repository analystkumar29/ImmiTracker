# ImmiTracker

ImmiTracker is a crowdsourced web application designed to help immigration applicants reduce anxiety during long application processes. It allows users to anonymously contribute and compare key application milestone dataâ€”such as submission dates and update timingsâ€”so they can see how their case compares to others in the same category.

## Features

- **Anonymous Application Tracking**: Track your immigration applications with minimal personal information
- **Program-Specific Milestones**: Each application type has its own set of milestones
- **Custom Milestone Management**: Add your own milestones and see them promoted if they become popular
- **Timeline Visualization**: Visual representation of your application's progress
- **Peer Comparison**: Compare your application timeline with aggregated data from similar cases
- **Community Insights**: Share experiences and tips with other applicants
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Redux for state management
- Material UI for components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- JWT for authentication
- TypeScript
